# Installation

## Requirements
To use **Timber ACF WP Blocks** you will need:
- Advanced Custom Fields Pro 5.8 or newer
- Timber

## Installation
Run the following in your Timber-based theme directory:
```sh
composer require "palmiak/timber-acf-wp-blocks"
```

Next you can create your blocks in your theme in **views/blocks** folder (you can change it with a filter).

> **Note**: filenames should only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and dashes, and must begin with a letter.



When you have your blocks ready the only thing left it to create a New group in ACF and select your block in **Show this field group if** selector.
